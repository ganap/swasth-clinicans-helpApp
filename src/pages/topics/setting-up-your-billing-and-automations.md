The Billing and Services page is where you set the foundation for all of your billing within Swasth Web App. These settings will apply across your Swasth Web App account and by taking a few minutes to set this up properly, you can seamlessly automate your practice billing.

To find these settings, click **Practice Management> Billing and Services > Settings**

The Settings tab contains seven sections that you'll want to set up before billing clients:

1.	Billing Settings

2.	Billing Address

3.	Invoice Settings

4.	Automated Statement and Superbill Generation

5.	Billing Document Delivery Delay

6.	Billing Documents for New Clients

7.	AutoPay

Billing Settings

**Billing Currency:** The options are USD or CAD. This also will set the currency that is used for Stripe payments.

**Tax ID (EIN) or SSN:** These will appear on claim forms and superbills. If you are not accepting insurance, there is no need to input this information.

**Organizational NPI:** Leave this field blank unless you have a Type-2 NPI, also known as an Organization, Group, or Billing NPI.

**Invoices Past Due:** You can select the number of days beyond which a past due designation will appear on invoices. You can also choose whether or not to email clients when an invoice is past due.

**Billing Address**

If you have multiple practice addresses or a specific billing address/P.O. Box you would prefer to use on your billing documents, you will select that address from this dropdown menu.

This section also includes the toggle to enable our Unit Billing feature. 

**Invoice Settings**

Invoices are the building blocks of our billing system and they allow you to bill your clients. This section allows you to choose the appointment descriptions that will display on your invoices and when to create these invoices: at the end of the day, the end of the month, or manually.

Most practices choose to have invoices automatically created at the end of the day. If you collect payment at the time of the appointment, this is the best option to select. If you bill monthly, then monthly invoice creation is the best option for your practice.

**Automated Statement and Superbill Generation**

Here you have the option to pick which day of the month you'd like statements and superbills to be created for your clients as long as you have billing automations set up.

We recommend choosing the 1st or 2nd day of the month if you collect payments and record them at the time of an appointment. If you collect or enter client payments after the appointment, then you will want to select a date later in the month.

**Billing Document Delivery Delay**

For your clients who receive billing documents via email or through their Client Portal, you can choose to delay the delivery of these documents. This creates a grace period between when a document is created and when it is sent, giving you time to review the document.

**Billing Documents for New Clients**

Here you can determine the default billing settings for every new client you create.

**AutoPay**

For clients that are enrolled in AutoPay, this feature automatically charges the client’s credit card that you have on file. You can enroll individual clients and disable it for others. AutoPay transactions run between 12:00-2:00am.
