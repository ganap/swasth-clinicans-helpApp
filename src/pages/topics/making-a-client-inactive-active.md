Swasth allows you to inactivate clients that you are not actively seeing. Making a client inactive will allow you to keep the client data in your account in case you choose to reactivate the client in the future. Additionally, inactive clients will not show up in your client list.

Swasth provides a very easy way to make the client Inactive or Active.

1. Select the client by clicking on Switch client button.

2. There will be toggle button displayed before the Add client button.

3. Click the toggle.

## **Note**: **If the toggle is** Purple **then the client is** Active. **And if the toggle is** Grey **that means the client is** Inactive
