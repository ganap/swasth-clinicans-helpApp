The Clinician Platform allows you to inactivate clients that you are not actively seeing. Making a client inactive will allow you to keep the client data in your account in case you choose to reactivate the client in the future. Additionally, inactive clients will not show up in your client list.

The system provides a very easy way to make the client **Inactive** or **Active**.

1. Select the client by clicking on Switch client button.
2. Click on toggle button on the Client Overview screen (it is right next to the 'Add client' button.
