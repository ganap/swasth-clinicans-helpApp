## Sign up

The first step of provider on-boarding is signup.

<div class="custom-alert-text"><b> Note:</b> If you already signed up to one of our mobile apps (DBT Coach, DBT Daily, CBT Companion etc.) then use a different email than what you signed up to those apps with. </div>

The reason you need to use a different email address is because the clinician app uses Two-Factor Authentication. We need to do for security and privacy of users' data.

## Account Confirmation

Once you sign up and verify email, we will verify your credentials and confirm your account. You will receive an email about your account being confirmed and then you can login.

## Two-Factor Authentication Setup

The very first time, you login you will have to set up Two-Factor Authentication. You have a choice of   either using your cell phone number (to receive the code via text message) or download Google Authenticator from [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) onto your mobile device.

If you choose Google Authenticator - you will need to set it up. You can refer to this [guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en). Once you set up authenticator to sync with your account, every time you login you will be asked for MFA code and you will enter the code from the authenticator app.
