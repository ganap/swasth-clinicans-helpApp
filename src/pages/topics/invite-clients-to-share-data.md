Once a client is added, and then made active (check this link), the client can go their Settings > Sharing settings and set the data items they want to share.

## Client sharing settings

 Clients on their Client App (DBT Coach, CBT Companion etc.),  will navigate to "Sharing Settings" screen using the left navigation bar (Settings > Sharing Settings). They will need to then click the '+' button and in the next screen enter the confirmation code and email address that they received in the email and click 'Submit' button. On the next screen they will check one more more diary card items that they want to share with you and click "Save".
